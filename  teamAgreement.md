# Project: Prep #1

## In this file we will write our plan during our project

## A) **Conflict Plan :**

### To start working on a project we should do a plan to avoid conflict so in our project we decide for each one of us to work on a different page so by doing that we may not face any conflict.

## If we get a conflict we will meet up and discuss how to resolve the conflict.

## B) **Communication Plan :**

### We are already connected with each other from 9:00-17:00 using zoom after that we have a slack channel to contact and we can create a zoom meeting if we need to discuss anything.

## C) **Work Plan :**

### In this project, we decide to manage our work using Trello to assign tasks for each one of us 

## D) **Git Process :**
 
## We created a GitHub organization to deploy our work and each one of us will create a Baruch to push his own work. and we will view each other pull request to see what he is doing and to know what changes we have.
